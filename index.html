I am moved that you prefer to watch the parasite ending with me as much as I'ld cheat death to make it happen.You haven't been feeling up lately so I thought I'll make up for it and get you some lilies. Keep them for a few days on your desk and you will see they are beginning to rot and die. Stick along and you'll realise that the very fact they died will prove they were real like every real thing out there and just as you begin to sulk over it's passing I will get you a new bouquet of flowers possibly jasmine this time. It'll be beautiful but with a different sight, a different sent and a different end just to make me get you a new bouquet all over again.
									
									Wish you well and hope to add some parasite to the 'too much perfect' flowers together.

								<div class="sig_name">Darling Margo,

									It's been a while I adored something real and it's been a while I succumbed to one. Yes I stand guilty about knowing the nature of lilies. Figured I could hint at my perpetual devotion without being explicit about it.
									
									You flatter me. Saving me an ending of a movie somewhere made me crave begin a new one. I would charge myself of negligence. Is it not just humane to have new characters make us live previous chapters?
									
									Your delicate rose leafed lips aren't made for anything other than the wildness of music or the reverent damp kisses, let alone to sip venom and end it all. Never do you dare attempt it again, never at least without making me a part of it. After all weren't these your own words?
									"I think you would be great company to watch the end of the movie with"
									
									You arrived with sunflowers on my doorstep and you wished I find hope in the darkest times. But don't they say, darkness is but lurking sun? Aren't you already aware of where my last hopes lie? Aren't you?
									
									You woudn't understand what I feel for you and I woudn't blame you for it. I always found you like the girl who'd love to own a flower shop someday. I have a pretty garden myself and I'll lend you flowers from it but alas it's only composed of lilies. I know how selfish this might sound but someday I hope you own a flower shop and I someday? I hope I am the only flower in it.
									
									With the darkness worthy of your wax
									Yours truly
									Ben

								<div class="sig_name">Sweetest Abhijeet,

									I wish you find your own name the best among all others someday, for I believe it is. Even with the nightmares attached to it. I know I have. Your hints are not at all subtle my friend. Each one of them makes their mark. Do you perhaps promise perpetual devotion to all your romantic interests or is it reserved for the more scarred ones? Nonetheless, maybe a more deserving candidate would cherish it rather than a mere damsel who has yet to figure out a way to prick out thorns from her fingers without shedding a tear. For now, I am still a concept. You'd find the real me a complete bore.
									
									My previous chapters were traumatic. I'd sooner wish to watch the world burn than revisit them. Then again, I'd wish to watch the world burn anyway. 
									
									Perhaps no person was ever so entranced by the sight of her own lips turning purple. Then again where do we stand with euthanasia? Live for yourself for being bound to anyone else is a terrible cause. The same goes for death.
									
									The funny thing about human nature, hope is what keeps us going. We're alive today because we hope for better endings. (Although I'm alive today because apparently I suck at killing myself too but small details) I write this as my parents are at each others' throats again and I feel a little less alive and hope that I finish studying the syllabus in time for my exams tomorrow. 
									Sunflowers and a helping hand are unfortunately all I have to call my own to offer.
									
									I've always believed that no person who has a pretty garden is a lost cause, just distraught. Then again I believe no person is a lost cause either way. Apart from myself because we are our harshest critics after all. I adore lilies. Their symbolism is much too strong or maybe it is for a person whose favorite language is the one of flowers. I'd like to believe that I will own a flower shop someday. I have a soft spot for delicate beings it seems.
									
									with sunflowers
									Khushi

								<div class="sig_name">Sweetheart Khushi

									I believe the Irish folklore is unappreciated. Can't recall the exact words or meaning but here is what I remember and how I'd put it.
									
									There was an unnatural taste to the wind. Confused he looked up for the light, attempting to figure the time. But the sky, wrapped in light and darkness in a way it felt as if the sun had broken into a million pieces and scattered all over the heavens to blend with the clouds. It was hard to tell why the whiter clouds seemed to float below the greyer ones.
									He couldn't remember his name, his wife or his taste. Seated on a wooden bench, the smell of it's rust mixing with the damp ferns it stood on filled his senses. An old lady approached. Removing and folding her scarf she fainted a smile. He knew it was a demon the moment he saw her. He just knew it. She looked like how a perfectly normal aged lady looks and carried nothing odd. He still knew it, he just did. Must've been the quality she brought along.
									"Your third wish, what will it be?"
									"Third?" his eyebrows tweaching. "What wishes? How can I wish a third time when there were no first and second wishes?"
									"Your first two wishes are exhausted, sir. Your second wish was to make you forget everything you know " lady spoke in a voice that carried with it no comfort, no grief, only a dreadful flat resignation . He noticed she was missing a tongue.
									"All right" he uttered confused not being able to recall what is it that he really wanted. "There is nothing to lose, I'll ask for my third one."
									"I wish to know who I truly am"
									"Funny" she said granting it and flaming up. "That was your first wish as well".
									-----
									Maybe why I don't use my actual name is because oblivion is comforting. Maybe because my reality dosn't really need me. Maybe because you aren't a part of it.
									Either way I had a thousand things to say and a thousand more to ask. I won't ask if you're well, for I know you're hurting.
									When you deserted, I was worried for the worst and was horrified of me not being a part of it. Wonder if I deserved it, for not caring hard enough for not responding when I should've. I wish I'd have done things differently. I wish I would've have mattered enough. 
									
									You keep saying you see a lot of what you used to be in me, and I keep saying after fulfilling our cliches that maybe we are the same person. Having a conversation with each other reflecting on what's been choking all along. Until now your last words were, "Wanna hear me cry?" and now I wonder if it was your grave sense of humor to leave me with a scalping cosmic pun. For soon I'm sure I'll hear someone weep and it won't be you. Not the you at least , who prefers sunflowers over lilies  but the you who'll take them to his grave nevertheless.
									
									I swear if you ditched me for death, I'll rip out the earth till there's no more mud left to bury you in.
									
									forever your last wish
									Abhijeet

								<div class="sig_name">Dearest Abhijeet,

									What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Thank you for introducing me to the wonderful world of Irish folklore. I wish I could introduce you to something new but I have a feeling you'd know more about anything I would bring up than me. All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages. I'm just a character, acting a role in your play. I will have my exit when it's time. I only hope you'd be prepared for when the time comes. Also, what's it with Shakespeare today? I think we're feeling the tragedies to our bones. If I made someone a part of it, it wouldn't really be 'deserting' then, will it? You call me Margo for a reason. Maybe I'm tired of this paper town. Any decision a person takes is bound to him and him alone. You can't really expect to deviate someone from it without triggering a butterfly effect. Hell, I don't even know why I'm typing out a reply right now. I think it has something to do with you being the first person to contact someone asking for me. Funny isn't it? I've known people for years and it happens to be a concept that is in search of me before any of them. Do you really want to put yourself through this heartbreak? Ideas don't last long after all. Yes I'm hurting but then again, who isn't? I'm unremarkable.
									
									You do remind me of what I used to be. I'd rather we not be the same people for I have never despised someone ever so much as I despise myself. Well, I am pretty funny I think. I also know now what a cigarette burn feels like. Brought back old memories of blood stained tiles and foggy mirrors reflecting soulless eyes. Maybe that's why my eyes are black. They lack the warmth. I prefer hope over devotion it seems. Choosing the lesser evil I suppose. Dear sweetest Abhijeet, have I ruined you this much already? Also, I see we've been listening to Don McLean. Great inspiration for that line I assume. Forgive me for my bland sentences. I've been watching You (the TV series :)). I've also finished the first season and two episodes of the second season. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. I shall try to steer clear of further episodes for you. But no promises. My last wish would be to see be buried amongst snowdrops and lilies (for they are the saddest flowers after all) and acanthus, shadowed by wooden canopies which bear apples and sweet sweet hope. Isolation gives me peace but it comes with a price for there are moments many of heartbreaking screams that shatter your very soul. I've also realized that I've typed nothing but absolute trash from the past I don't know how many minutes but hey, at least I'm good at fast correspondence. Compared to you anyway. Thank you for reading through my unmethodical (it's a real word I googled) sentences but I hope it gives you the illusion of me being alright. Also, it looks like you're the one showing withdrawal symptoms from when I last had to switch my phone back on for a very brief period of time because again, we rely on our devices a lot unfortunately. Again, have I ruined you this much already? I also want to binge on cream and cookies ice cream and strawberry waffles, get fat, move to the himalayas and own nine cats. We'll see how that works out. Have I convinced you that I'm fine already? Is this believable enough?

								<div class="sig_name">I was promised an email today and I hate broken promises. But I did after all promise that I'd write something for you as well.

									If only words could come easy when I write for every letter I write holds a piece of me. The pieces you'd not catch a glimpse of when you talk to me after you've run into me on the street by accident, or when you see me laughing along with the people I cherish as my own. Although you might come across them sometimes when I think no one's looking. When my hair is fanned out below me and shallow puffs of breath leave my mouth, open slightly and my chest rising and falling down slowly but surely. You'd see my forehead marred by the slightest of frowns which speak of tales unknown and dreams unvisited or were they nightmares all along? Or when my eyes find solace in watching a pretty bird with a broken wing and I'd watch unblinking as it flaps away with it's tiny heart barely holding it's broken body up and you'd really see me for who I am and you'd catch a glimpse of the broken pieces I carry around as my own and you'd hurt. You'd hurt for me.
									
									Sorry but I did mention that I'm a trashy writer. I also thought you might like a passage I came across today. 
									
									"Grow strong, my comrade... that you may stand unshaken when I fall; that I may know the shattered fragments of my song will come at last to finer melody in you; that I may tell my heart that you begin where passing I leave off, and fathom more." 
									
									Wish I could write something like this but eh. Ironically, I also came across a username _make.a.wish_ . How funny. 
									I hope you are well.

								<div class="sig_name">Dearest Briare

									It's 1847, and I've been constantly fighting me now. Been hours and I couldn't figure how will i break off this apology, but guess there isn't a better way. I could say, I've been caught up in the seasonal charades, time became disfigured, or how i intentionally scarred my heart and left it bleeding out velvet blood blending in polished dirt and a thousand other excuses. But the truth?
									
									The truth, it's painful to squeeze out words when they're supposed to be for you. All my efforts seem so blur at the end as soon as I'd reached the conclusion. Truth? I've no idea how endings work. Competent enough to write beautiful ones but never to live through the characters who bring them. Not without leaving behind a little sketchy detail, a slight sliver of hope a something to trigger another new beginning. Perhaps, something i took from this Conan Doyle, a writing pal of mine.
									
									Even after I gathered the courage of facing my own failures and writing though it all, the most important essay I've ever written. I just couldn't send it over. Maybe i think I didn't run out of words earlier. For, like you every word i write holds a piece of me, and maybe just maybe I ran out of me. I've got a billion things to tell, a billion things to ask and a billion words to use but only a few chunks of me left. There's always someone who will give you more, be hotter, will give you everything you want but only one who will give you everything he had. Christmas is around and I've saved for gifts and lost my faith.
									
									Hey Blaire! I'd not waste the best part of my day on sulking. It's been a happening year, 1847. Interesting books, papers and arts all around. The crowd enjoys plays in the Broadway theater but the plague has put on a better show. We'll watch it together sometime. Time's being good, only the other day I found it in a ballroom dance, stabbing and kissing a bird to the point of death. Such is it's need to play poke and kill.
									
									The one winged bird you talk of, limping as it flies must have such a strong hope. To keep going. It looks forward to something, something probably waiting at the other end for him. I envy it.
									
									Always wanting to read you, constantly looking for the mail to drop by has become a religion. Letters are the only escape, I've stopped using maps. Found better things for reference, to guide me to the shore. Also, look after your food and maybe avoid people with flu so you don't end up watching the plague without me. Kinda in a hurry right now, came across this new book one of my friend published this season. It's an interesting read perhaps you'll like it, in fact I'll save you a copy. Save it somewhere in the stones, it'll remain safe for years. A few lines from it goes,
									" He might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares!"
									another one which i really like,
									" The entire world is a collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her."
									
									I have no idea what the _make.a.wish_ thing meant, I am not on good terms with wishes. But i wonder if it has got something to do with a sketchy detail at the end, you know like Conan Doyle writes, might hint at a new beginning someday somewhere. The sign of three my' lady.
									
									with a smile
									Joe

A sorry dosn't nearly cover it, let alone an explanation but for what it's worth I tried doing what sounded best for both of us back then. Tried being benevolent and all and yet I keep going back to those little crumbs we left behind. Dosn't sound like me but ugh am I guilty of anxiously checking in on mails and stories looking constantly for something that's never gonna be there.

									Someone once asked if I have a mind map or something for coming up sliding with all those images between conversations. Ah well I am not sure what do I do with it anymore but here ya go - (not all of it duh)
									
									Ps.  Instinctively shaved my head few days back idk why, not Justin Bieber anymore..(Well ah..)
